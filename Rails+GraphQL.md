## 1. What is GraphQL

In this assignment we will ask you to create the Ruby on Rails application that uses GraphQL.
GraphQL was invented by FaceBook as an alternative function for RESTful  function. 
By using this function, you can call a resource (index (all) data of blogs, etc.) by a method different from the routing of resources.

When comparing RESTful and GraphQL, there are the following differences.

|        | RESTful    |graphQL    |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| Required URL | Many   | Basically only one​ ​    |
| Number of calls   | A lot | Less | 
| Conditional expression  | The query|
| HTTP Method  | Get, Post, Put, Delete  | Post only   \| |
